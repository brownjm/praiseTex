by: Edward Mote and William B. Bradbury
order: verse 1, chorus, verse 2, chorus, verse 3, chorus, verse 4, chorus

verse 1:
   D                A
My hope is built on nothing less
     Em               A        D
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
  D                  A
I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
    G              A      D
But wholly lean on Jesus' name.


chorus:
   D                G
On Christ the Solid Rock I stand;
    D                       A
All other ground is sinking sand.
    Bm           G  A       D
All other ground is sinking sand.


verse 2:
     D                  A
When darkness veils His lovely face
  Em            A        D
I rest on His unchanging grace.
   D              A
In every high and stormy gale
   G                A      D
My anchor holds within the veil.



verse 3:
    D              A
His oath, His covenant, His blood
   Em             A        D
Support me in the whelming flood.
     D             A
When all around my soul gives way,
   G              A        D
He then is all my hope and stay.



verse 4:
     D                  A
When He shall come with trumpet sound,
  Em            A      D
O may I then in Him be found.
        D               A
Dressed in His righteousness alone,
     G               A        D
Faultless to stand before the throne.
