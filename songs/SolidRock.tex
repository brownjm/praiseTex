\songtitle{The Solid Rock}
\by{Edward Mote and William B. Bradbury}

\verse {
  My \chord{D}hope is built on \chord{A}nothing less\\
  Than \chord{Em}Jesus' blood and \chord{A}righteous\chord{D}ness.\\
  I \chord{D}dare not trust the \chord{A}sweetest frame,\\
  But \chord{G}wholly lean on \chord{A}Jesus' \chord{D}name.
}


\chorus {
  On \chord{D}Christ the Solid \chord{G}Rock I stand;\\
  All \chord{D}other ground is sinking \chord{A}sand.\\
  All \chord{Bm}other ground \chord{G}is \chord{A}sinking \chord{D}sand.
}

\verse {
  When \chord{D}darkness veils His \chord{A}lovely face\\
  I \chord{Em}rest on His un\chord{A}changing \chord{D}grace.\\
  In \chord{D}every high and \chord{A}stormy gale\\
  My \chord{G}anchor holds with\chord{A}in the \chord{D}veil.\\
  \tochorus
}

\verse {
  His \chord{D}oath, His coven\chord{A}ant, His blood\\
  Sup\chord{Em}port me in the \chord{A}whelming \chord{D}flood.\\
  When \chord{D}all around my \chord{A}soul gives way,\\
  He \chord{G}then is all my \chord{A}hope and \chord{D}stay.\\
  \tochorus
}

\verse {
  When \chord{D}He shall come with \chord{A}trumpet sound,\\
  O \chord{Em}may I then in \chord{A}Him be \chord{D}found.\\
  Dressed \chord{D}in His righteous\chord{A}ness alone,\\
  Fault\chord{G}less to stand be\chord{A}fore the \chord{D}throne.\\
  \tochorus
}
