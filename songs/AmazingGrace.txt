title: Amazing Grace
by: John Newton, 1779

verse 1:
 G      G/B        C         G
Amazing grace! How sweet the sound
     Em      A           D D7
That saved a wretch like me!
  G        G7        C      G
I once was lost, but now am found,
    Em        D     C G
Was blind but now I see.

verse 2:
      G          G/B       C        G
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
    Em       A        D   D7
And grace my fears relieved.
    G        G7       C       G
How precious did that grace appear
    Em     D       C G
The hour I first believed!

verse 3:
        G    G/B     C         G
Through many dangers toils and snares
  Em     A     D   D7
I have already come.
     G          G7         C         G
'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,
    Em         D       C G
and grace will lead me home.

verse 4:
    G        G/B      C       G
The Lord has promised good to me,
    Em      A      D   D7
His Word my hope secures;
   G       G7         C       G
He will my shield and portion be
   Em      D      C G
As long as life endures.

verse 5:
    G         G/B       C           G
And when this flesh and heart shall fail
    Em     A          D   D7
And mortal life shall cease.
  G        G7      C       G
I shall possess within the veil
  Em      D       C G
A life of joy and peace.

verse 6:
     G          G/B       C        G
When we've been there ten thousand years
       Em      A      D D7
Bright shining as the sun
      G       G7      C          G
We've no less days to sing God's praise
     Em        D       C G
Than when we'd first begun.
