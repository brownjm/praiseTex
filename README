praiseTex was designed to run on GNU/Linux, Mac and Windows provided you have
the required packages:

    Latex, including pdflatex and Beamer
    Python 2.7+ or 3.x+, including Tkinter (most versions already have this)


The easiest way to produce chord sheets or presentations is with the GUI:

    python gui.py


If you'd prefer a command line version (and you're on a Unix based computer),
then use the following bash scripts. These do not require Python.

    ./chords song1.tex song2.tex ...
    ./slides sont1.tex song2.tex ...


All song files must adhere to the format shown in exampleSong.tex, which is 
located in folder 'latex'. Do not edit the files chords.tex and slides.tex. 
They are used as templates for producing the repective files.

Folder structure is important. Please place song files within the 'songs' 
subfolder.
