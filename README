praiseTex was designed to run on GNU/Linux, Mac and Windows provided
you have the required packages:

    Latex, including pdflatex and Beamer
    Python 2.7+ or 3.2+, including Tkinter (most versions have this)


The easiest way to produce chordsheets or slides is with the
GUI:

    python praisetex.py


All of the features in the GUI are also available via command line. If
you'd prefer a command line version use

    python praisetex.py -h


to print out a helpful list of all the options. 


All song files must adhere to the format shown in
ExampleSong.txt. Song files are written in plain ascii text using any
simple text editor (not MS word or OpenOffice, just plain
text). Please put your songs into the folder 'songs'.


Important: Do not edit the files inside the folder 'latex' unless you
know what you are doing. They are used as templates for producing
chordsheets and slides.
