praiseTex was designed to run on GNU/Linux, Mac and Windows provided
you have the required packages:

    Latex, including pdflatex and Beamer
    Python 2.7+ or 3.2+, including Tkinter (most versions have this)


The easiest way to produce chord sheets or presentations is with the
GUI:

    python praisetex.py


All of the features in the GUI are also available via command line. If
you'd prefer a command line version

    python praisetex.py -h


will print out a helpful list of all the options. 


All song files must adhere to the format shown in exampleSong.tex,
which is located in folder 'latex'. Praisetex can take a typical
guitar chord sheet found online, where chords are placed above words
using spaces, and partially convert it into a proper song file. You
can access this tool within the praisetex GUI or run one of the
following:

    python praisetex.py --convert [filename]


The output will be named: [filename].tex. The user will have to edit
the file further, in order for it to be usable by praiseTex. This
script only took care of the tedious part of placing chords in the
correct position within lyrics. The user will still section the text
into \verse{}, \prechorus{} and \chorus{} structures, fill in the
title and author, and add any goto hints such as \tochorus or
\toprechorus.


Once song files are in the proper format, they can be transposed into
a different key using

    python praisetex.py --transpose N [filename]


where N is the number of half steps.


Important: Do not edit the files chords.tex and slides.tex. They are
used as templates for producing the repective files. Folder structure
is important, therefore please place song files within the 'songs'
subfolder.


If you're on a Unix based computer and don't want to use Python, then
the following bash scripts to produce chords and slides are available.

    ./chords song1.tex song2.tex ...
    ./slides song1.tex song2.tex ...
